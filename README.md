## **EDA and Feature Engineering**

### **1. Red Wine Dataset - EDA**
Analyzed physicochemical and sensory data for Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and performed in-depth EDA to uncover key insights from this imbalanced dataset

### **2. Flight Price Prediction - Feature Engineering**
Worked on a dataset containing features like source city, departure/arrival times, destination city, etc. The goal was to convert all the categorical features into numerical values, making the dataset ready for training a machine learning model. Transformed categorical columns into numerical values through feature engineering, preparing the data for machine learning model training.

### **3. Google Play Store Dataset - EDA and Feature Engineering**
#### Problem Statement:
With 1.85 million apps available on Google Play Store, the goal is to identify trends such as the most popular category, the app with the largest number of installs, and the app with the largest size.

#### Data Collection:
The dataset consists of 20 columns and 10,841 rows.

#### Steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering

## **Linear, Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet Regression**

### **Algerian Forest Fire Dataset**
Explored the "Algerian Forest Fires Dataset" to uncover meaningful insights and build predictive models for the Fire Weather Index (FWI). Ensured dataset accuracy through rigorous data cleaning, performed detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends, and engineered relevant features to enhance model performance. Applied advanced feature selection techniques to pinpoint the most impactful attributes based on correlation. Trained and evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet Regression, to predict FWI. Fine-tuned the models with hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation, achieving robust results for this regression problem.

#### Dataset information:
- Regions Covered: Bejaia (Northeast Algeria) and Sidi Bel-abbes (Northwest Algeria)
- Timeframe: June to September 2012
- Instances: 244 (122 per region)
- Attributes: 11 features and 1 output (fire or no fire classification: 138 fire, 106 no fire)
#### Note: Since this was a regression problem statement, considered FWI as the dependent feature and computed it based on all the independent features.

#### Steps:
1. Cleaning the Dataset
2. EDA and Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Training (using Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet Regression)
5. Hyperparameter tuning (Using Cross Validation)

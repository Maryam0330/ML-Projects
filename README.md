## **EDA and Feature Engineering**

### **1. Red Wine Dataset - EDA**
Analyzed physicochemical and sensory data for Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and performed in-depth EDA to uncover key insights from this imbalanced dataset

### **2. Flight Price Prediction - Feature Engineering**
Worked on a dataset containing features like source city, departure/arrival times, destination city, etc. The goal was to convert all the categorical features into numerical values, making the dataset ready for training a machine learning model. Transformed categorical columns into numerical values through feature engineering, preparing the data for machine learning model training.

### **3. Google Play Store Dataset - EDA and Feature Engineering**
#### Problem Statement:
With 1.85 million apps available on Google Play Store, the goal is to identify trends such as the most popular category, the app with the largest number of installs, and the app with the largest size.

#### Data Collection:
The dataset consists of 20 columns and 10,841 rows.

#### Steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering

## **Linear, Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet Regression**

### **Algerian Forest Fire Dataset**
#### Dataset information:
The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria, namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

122 instances for each region.

The period from June 2012 to September 2012.
The dataset includes 11 attributes and 1 output attribute (class).
The 244 instances have been classified into fire (138 classes) and not fire (106 classes) classes.

#### Steps:
1. Cleaning the Dataset
2. EDA and Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Training (using Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso and ElasticNet Regression)
5. Hyperparameter tuning (Using Cross Validation)

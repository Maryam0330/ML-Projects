## EDA and Feature Engineering

### **1. Red Wine Dataset - EDA**
Analyzed physicochemical and sensory data for Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and performed in-depth EDA to uncover key insights from this imbalanced dataset

### **2. Flight Price Prediction - Feature Engineering**
Worked on a dataset containing features like source city, departure/arrival times, destination city, etc. The goal was to convert all the categorical features into numerical values, making the dataset ready for training a machine learning model. Transformed categorical columns into numerical values through feature engineering, preparing the data for machine learning model training.

### **3. Google Play Store Dataset - EDA and Feature Engineering**
#### Problem Statement:
With 1.85 million apps available on Google Play Store, the goal is to identify trends such as the most popular category, the app with the largest number of installs, and the app with the largest size.

#### Data Collection:
The dataset consists of 20 columns and 10,841 rows.

#### Steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
